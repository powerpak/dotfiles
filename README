powerpak's dotfiles
===================

In general:
-----------

git clone into ~/dotfiles (or ~/.dotfiles), then symlink as needed into ~

For .bash_profile:
------------------

Don't symlink; instead, edit existing .bashrc or .bash_profile, and add:

  source dotfiles/.bash_profile

Then set the color of the prompt and the hostname by adding:

  export PSCOLOR=$COLOR_(BLACK|CYAN|BLUE|RED|GRAY|BROWN|GREEN|PURPLE)
  export PSHOST="computah"
